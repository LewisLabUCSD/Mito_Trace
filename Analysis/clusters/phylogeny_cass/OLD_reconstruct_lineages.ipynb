    "\n",
    "The minimum input for reconstructing trees with Cassiopeia is a **character matrix** , consisting of indel measurements for **M** *characters* across **N** cells. Here, the term \"character\" is an abstract term referring to variables containing information about where cells lie in some phylogeny. In our technology, these are individual target sites -- i.e. those sites targeted by Cas9 and subsequently accumulate indels. More generally, these can be nulceotide positions in DNA or even phenotypic observations of an animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use this abstract data structure because it is general enough for any technology, and does not rely on any assumption other than one can *phase* the observations (i.e. you have the ability to index mutations by where they occurred). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we begin by describing how one takes an allele table from our PreProcessing Pipeline and converting into a character matrix. To do so, we not only specify an allele table but also a target lineage group (i.e. clone) to reconstruct"

    "\n",
    "As a brief detour, we can estimate the indel priors from the allele tables by measuring the proportion of intBCs that report a given indel across independent clones. The idea behind this is that we'd like to subset the data into groups of independent sets (i.e. those that are not related to one another at all) as this will eliminate the possiblity of \"double counting\" indels because they were inherited. Inevitably, we will underestimate the propensity of a given indel to occur if it happened many times in the same location (as we choose to assume this only occurs by inheritance); however, the more independent groups we have, the greater our ability to estimate priors.\n",

If this is the case, Cassiopeia has returned what we call a *state-tree*: because multiple cells can report the same set of alleles, or states, Cassiopeia reconstructs over the unique states rather than all cells. It thus returns a tree that proposes a phylogenetic relationship over these states. Taken together, we'll need to append cells back to the leaves of the tree using the `post-process` functionality. This does three things:\n",

    "\n",
    "Congrats! You've successfully created a character matrix, reconstructed a tree, and post-processed it. You are now at the stage where you can make hypotheses regarding how cells are related to one another, and if you have paired phenotypic measurements for each cell (e.g. single-cell RNAseq), you can start integrating these two orthogonal measurements to see how phenotypes are inherited. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, we have some key suggestions - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We suggest you take a look at the concordance between alleles and trees. This can be done two ways:\n",
    "    - This can be done by plotting an \"indel heatmap\", which we've provided a script for creating in scripts/alleletable_2_heatmap.py. This will take in an allele table and produce a data structure that resembles a character matrix though it retains the indel identities. You can plot this indel heatmap using [ITOL](https://itol.embl.de/), or another package like [phytools](http://blog.phytools.org/). \n",
    "    - You can explore the relationship between \"allele distance\" and \"phylogenetic distance\". We have provided functionality for computing both of these items simultaneously with `utiliites.compute_pairwise_dist_nx`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. As noted above, there are several ways to visualize the tree. We've found success, especially with larger trees, with [ITOL](https://itol.embl.de/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are several packages for doing tree-based analysis that you can use to study evolutionary relationships between cells. We've found the following usefule: [ETE3](http://etetoolkit.org/), [Biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Phylo), and [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/). These have nice functionality around traversing a tree, visualizing sub-clades, and more. All of them have functionality for reading in trees from newick format. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. On integrating RNA-seq and tree information, we recommend using [Hotspot](https://yoseflab.github.io/Hotspot/) which has a module specifically for phylogenetic trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We are currently in the process of building ou the cassiopeia.Analysis module, which thus far only has functionality for running *FitchCount* which quantifies how plastic different states are in a tree given the states at the leaves. You can read more about this in our recent [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.045245v2). "
