## Introduction
In order to determine if we have a sufficient number of reads, cells, and power to detect CHIP expansion, we generated simulated data based on mitochondrial mutation rate, cell division rates, and clone sizes. 
We hope that this analysis will help answer two questions: 
a) Is the mutation rate of the MTs high enough to detect different clones? 
b) Can we properly distinguish clonal expansion in certain dominant CHIP clones from noise that may occur in the non-CHIP donor samples (unless other clones do expand, in that case we would want to learn about that as well).
