This project uses conda as a package manager, and sets up our module in
a package called 'src'. Two internal packages were also used. Setup is
as follows.

Download the Mito_Trace package from github. Once you download,
go into the folder and type 'pip install -e .'. This will install
the project.

To install the dependencies, look at the environment.yaml file
in environments. The way we installed our packages are as follows:
Using miniconda3, python version 3.7.

`conda update conda`
`conda install -c rmg glibc`
