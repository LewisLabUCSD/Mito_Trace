# CALLER SPECIFIC PARAMETERS
# These parameters are used by the pipeline when it executes each of the callers.
# All caller specific parameters are optional except where otherwise noted as
# "required" in the comments below.
# You can specify:
#   1) cols - any other columns (besides CHROM, POS, REF, and ALT) to extract from the VCFs output by each caller
#      (note that this attribute will be ignored if your caller script outputs a TSV instead of a VCF)
#   2) params - any extra parameters that should be passed to the caller script
#   3) ext - whether your caller outputs a VCF (assumed if not specified) or a TSV
#   4) na - replacement values to use (instead of the default value of 0) when filling NA's
#      (note that this is ignored if 'keep_na' is set to true in config.yaml or prepare.yaml)
# Each key should be the <caller_id> and each value can be a dictionary containing any of the attributes listed above
# "cols" should be a dictionary of lists for each category of columns in the VCF (where categories can be 'info', 'format', and 'other' for all others)
# "params" can be a single string or a list of strings
# "na" should be a dictionary containing as keys each column name and as values the replacement value
# Note that the trained classification models we provide in the example data
# only work with these settings. So if you change any of the "cols" or "na"
# values, you will also need to create new trained classification models.
